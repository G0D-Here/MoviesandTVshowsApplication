# 📸 AI Landmark Recognition App  

An AI-powered landmark recognition app using **Jetpack Compose, CameraX, and TensorFlow Lite** to identify landmarks in real-time.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Real-time camera preview (CameraX)  
✅ AI-based landmark recognition (TensorFlow Lite)  
✅ Optimized image processing & classification  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Kotlin** (Jetpack Compose)  
- **CameraX** (Live camera feed)  
- **TensorFlow Lite** (AI model for classification)

## 📸 How It Works  
1️⃣ Captures camera frames using CameraX  
2️⃣ Processes & crops images for AI model  
3️⃣ Uses **`landmark.tflite`** to classify landmarks  
4️⃣ Displays results in real-time  

## 🔧 Setup  
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open in **Android Studio**  
3. Place **`landmark.tflite`** in the `assets/` folder  
4. Run on a **physical device**  

## ⚠️ Common Issues  
- **FileNotFoundException: landmark.tflite** → Ensure the model file is in `assets/`  
- **Camera permission not granted** → Enable it in device settings  

🚀 **Enjoy landmark recognition with AI!**
